# voter_id

A voter ID management system is a software application that helps to manage the registration, verification, and issuance of voter IDs. It is typically implemented using C++ and includes modules for voter registration, voter verification, voter ID issuance, and voter ID tracking. The system helps to ensure that only eligible voters are registered and that they have valid IDs to vote. It also helps to prevent voter fraud and ensure the integrity of elections.
